This is my notes and code while studying algorithms in Java.

## Why Java?

I like Java. It is statically typed. It is useful to exactly know the variable types at compile time. This is even more true when studying algorithms. 'Nuff said.

## What algorithms?

- Searching
- Sorting
- Data structures
